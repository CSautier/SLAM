update the timestamps of variables i don't want to lose yet.
The idea would be : as long as there has not been n more observation of the landmark, or k more odometry, and the timestamp difference makes that a variable would be deleted, then give it t more seconds to live, where t is proportionnal with the time between 2 odometries

Even better idea : replace timestamps with indexes and do the same thing, except it will be more readable and i might have a constant number of variables.

  /** Update the Timestamps associated with the keys */
  updateKeyTimestampMap(const KeyTimestampMap& newTimestamps);

  /** Find all of the keys associated with timestamps before the provided time */
findKeysBefore(double t)

marginalizeLeaves(

for each object in the landmark map
if lastindex not zero
compute ind of lastindex -1 or 1 if lastindex = 1
check its timestamp
compare it to the last timestamp added
if (last timestamp -  penultimate landmark timestamp) >= lag
	penultimate landmark timestamp = last timestamp - lag + 1
	last landmark timestamp = max(penultimate landmark timestamp +1, last landmark timestamp)
